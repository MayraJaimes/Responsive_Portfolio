#Portfolio

I built a professional portfolio site using HTML/CSS. It has an aesthetically pleasing layout while using different kinds of complex HTML elements. I styled my pages with CSS. There were specifications were provided by my Northwestern Instructor that had to be met for this portfolio assignment.

There are three pages that makeup my portfolio. The first is the index in which I add information about myself along with my photo. On the side there is a section with three icons that will link the user to my Github profile, my StackOverflow profile, and my LinkedIn profile. This is a section that is on all three of my pages so that the user can easily access those links to my profiles. I then have my portfolio page with the links to the different projects I have. Lastly, there is the contact page which allows users to send me a message and connect with me.

I also added media queries in my website to make it a mobile-responsive layout. The media queries are found at the end of my styles.css file. The media queries used are: these `min-width`s: `980px`, `768px` and `640px`.

I used `980px` because it is about the width of a desktop. Then `768px` is about the width of a tablet and `640px` is about the width of a phone in landscape.

Technologies used:
HTML,
CSS, 
Media Queries
