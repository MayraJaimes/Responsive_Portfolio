			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<div class="description">
				<img src="assets/images/portfoliopic.jpg" alt="My picture">
				<p>I was born in San Diego, California but was raised in Chicago, Illinois. I then left Chicago to attend Georgetown University in Washington, DC where I received my bachelor’s degree. After graduating I came back to Chicago and joined Teach for America in order serve and give back to my community. I taught at a Chicago Public School as a second grade bilingual teacher. After my time in the program I became a case manager for a health insurance company where I served the medicaid/medicare population by helping them manage their health needs. </p>
				<p>I then came across coding as I did research on starting a new career where I would be able to use my creativity and my passion for learning. I started using free online resources to see if it was something I was interested in it. Very quickly I was experiencing great excitement as I worked through coding challenges. I knew right away this was something I wanted to do for a career. I am now completing the Web Development Boot Camp at Northwestern University to obtain the tools necessary to change my career and become a web developer. </p>
